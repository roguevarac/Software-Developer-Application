Q3 Explanation
The original function name 'do_sth_with_PlayerParty' is not descriptive, so I renamed it to 'removePlayerFromParty' to crearly indicate its purpose.
The variable 'membername' didn't really tell me much about what it was holding, changed it to 'playerName' to make it obvious.
The loop was a bit confusing with the 'k, v' variables, refactored the loop to use 'pairs' directly with 'party:getMembers()'.
The comparison 'v == Player(membername)' checks for object equality, wich may not work as intended, so i changed it to 'member:getName() == playerName' to compare player names properly. 
And then, added print messages to indicate whether the player was succesfully removed from the party or not.
